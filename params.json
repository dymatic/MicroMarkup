MicroMarkup takes this to a new level. With the separation of literals from the source files, you will:\r\n\r\n1. Make Translating a breeze.\r\n2. Clean up your messy General / Global declarations\r\n3. Take advantage of the rich data-input technique of Template and Template instances.\r\n\r\nSo step in using the links below. Use the source, read the source, love the source, and when the source betrays you, commit a bug fix or candidate patch. That is the power of Open Source!\r\n\r\n### Learning / Downloading MML\r\n[Wiki - Growing every day](https://github.com/dymatic/MicroMarkup/wiki)\r\n\r\n[Code - Beware of nested gits!](https://github.com/dymatic/MicroMarkup)\r\n\r\n### Applications\r\nNo known Applications (in the \"App\" sense) that user MicroMarkup exist. But here are a few examples where MicroMarkup would excel in being used:\r\n\r\n* Configurations - Imagine being able to define your configuration in plain text. No more messy arrays / parsing!\r\n\r\n    `explicit object named config{\r\n\r\n    :allow_crunch -true\r\n\r\n    :allow_learn  -true\r\n\r\n    :allow_expl   -false\r\n\r\n    }`\r\n\r\n* Dialogue for games. As I mentioned earlier, translating a MicroMarkup file is FAR easier than translating a source file, and in a lot of cases more straightforward in referencing objects.\r\n\r\n    `explicit object named dialogue{\r\n\r\n    :reporterQuery -Linux\r\n\r\n    :stallmanReply -I would just like to interject for a moment. What you are referring to as...\r\n\r\n    }`\r\n\r\n* Collections of ANY sort. This language was originally developed for use in a package manager, so a list of installed files for installation / removing would be useful.\r\n\r\n    `implicit object named files{\r\n\r\n    -/usr/share/pixmpas/MicroMarkup.png\r\n\r\n    -/usr/bin/mmlExe.out\r\n\r\n    -/home/jack/.microMarkup/*\r\n\r\n    }`\r\n\r\nWhatever the application, there is always room for a nice, readable file to go along with it.","name":"Micromarkup","google":"","tagline":"MicroMarkup is a modern modern markup language that translates itself into immutable Clojure data structures."}
