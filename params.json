MicroMarkup takes this to a new level. With the separation of literals from the source files, you will:\r\n\r\n1. Make Translating a breeze.\r\n2. Clean up your messy General / Global declarations\r\n3. Take advantage of the rich data-input technique of Template and Template instances.\r\n\r\nSo step in using the links below. Use the source, read the source, love the source, and when the source betrays you, commit a bug fix or candidate patch. That is the power of Open Source!\r\n\r\n### Learning / Downloading MML\r\n[Wiki - Growing every day](https://github.com/dymatic/MicroMarkup/wiki)\r\n\r\n[Code - Beware of nested gits!](https://github.com/dymatic/MicroMarkup)","name":"Micromarkup","tagline":"MicroMarkup is a modern modern markup language that translates itself into immutable Clojure data structures.","note":"Don't delete this file!
