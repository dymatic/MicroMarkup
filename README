# mml
MicroMarkup. A new frontier of languages pushing the boundaries of human readability with searchable data structures. Now with extra lein!

# Version
1.6 was released today with absolutely no changes over 1.5 except for one notable change. It's lein'd into a .jar for real usage. Enjoy.

## Usage
See the wiki. You have a .mml (move out, marathon markup) that will map Clojure (and ultimitely Java) data types with three kinds of objects.
