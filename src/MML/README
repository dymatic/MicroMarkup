Welcome!

This is the MicroMarkup markup language for Clojure data structures. This README will give you
a brief synopsis of the project's history, future plans, and how to use MicroMarkup. Over the next few days I will be refactoring code HEAVILY, renaming some things, documenting, migrating, etc. so be ready for heavy incompatibility from Dec 01 - Dec 10th if you want to use MicroMarkup.

===What is MicroMarkup?
MicroMarkup is what I call a resource language. Like what you would consider a configuration file to be.
It's not quite markup, but it is more than just a resource. Thus, "MicroMarkup".
Using MicroMarkup a programmer can create an external mapping of Clojure resources and a custom data type called an instance, along with templates.

MicroMarkup uses a very light syntax that is much up to the person using it. C-style braces now work! As do types. 

===Future plans
In order of importance:

Vector / List support ~ Dec 30th
MML file write support ~ Jan 15th

===License
This is licensed under the GNU GPL V2 license. It was a lot of work to put together, and I want to see the community benefit from it; not corporations that could write a far more efficient version. 

===Help
The wiki and website are now up under my github page. For more information on mml, go and see http://dymatic.github.com/MicroMarkup/
